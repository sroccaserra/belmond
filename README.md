Small test to explore CoffeeScript and HTML5 canvas. At the moment, it's just a bunch of random transparent rectangles moving around on a gradient background.

Depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/).

Uses [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node) as a spec framework, and [villain](https://github.com/stephank/villain) to sort dependencies and bundle sources.

If you have [Watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) installed, `watchr watch.rb` will start autotest mode.

But if you don't care about the code, just start `site/index.html` and watch the random rectangles cross the canvas.
