Small test (see it [here](http://sroccaserra.github.com/belmond/)) to explore CoffeeScript and HTML5 canvas. At the moment, it's just a bouncing text and a bunch of random transparent rectangles moving around on a gradient background.

Dependencies
------------

Depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/).

Libraries
---------

It uses [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node) as a spec framework, and [villain](https://github.com/stephank/villain) to sort dependencies and bundle sources (both are in the `lib/` directory).

Autotest
--------

If you have [Watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) installed, `watchr watch.rb` will start autotest mode.
